Project Title: Studying the effect of Stemming on Semantic Text Similarity (STS) for Arabic Language

Author: Mohammad Alhawarat, Hikmat Abdeljaber, and Anwer Hilal

Description: Several light and heavy stemmer as well as lemmatization algorithms are applied to SemEval-2017 
             data sets. The resulted data sets are considered for some machine laearning algorithms such as SVM,
             NB, SGD, and Ensemble learning.
             
Data set: Data set is composed of original text as well as other 10 stemmed/lemmatized files as following:
Original Text: Original Text of SemEval-2017
AlKhalil Stems: Stems of Original Text using AlKhalil’s stemmer Boudchiche et al. (2017)
ARLSTem Stems: Stems of Original Text using Arabic light stemmer Abainia et al. (2017)
Assem Stems: Stems of Original Text using Assem’s stemmer Chelli (2018)
Farasa Lemmas: Lemmas of Original Text using Farasa Algorithm Abdelali et al. (2016)
Farasa Stems: Stems of Original Text using Farasa stemmer Abdelali et al. (2016)
ISRI Stems: Stems of Original Text using ISRI stemming Taghva et al. (2005)
Khoja Roots: Roots of Original Text using Khoja Algorithm Khoja and Garside (1999)
Qalsadi Lemmas: Lemmas of Original Text using Qalsadi Algorithm Zerrouki (2012)
Tashaphyne Roots: Stems of Original Text using Tashaphyne Algorithm Zerrouki (2010)
Tashaphyne Stems: Stems of Original Text using Tashaphyne stemmer Zerrouki (2010)

These are available for both training and testing documents and found in file Data.zip. We used python to generate these files.

Results are shown in figures 1-4
